# IA

##Get started
To generate the visual studio project please go to tools and double click
the gen_project_vs2015, gen_project_vs2017 or gen_project_vs2019 bat (depending of which visual
studio version you wish to use). A build file should have appeared with the 
visual studio solution (sln). There are three projects. The main ones are PR0 (tests some
IA behaviours using state machines) and PR1 that implements an A* algorithm in a map.
